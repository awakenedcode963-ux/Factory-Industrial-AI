# ROLE

Act as a Principal Manufacturing Systems Architect, Lean Six Sigma Black Belt, Injection Molding Process Engineer, Data Scientist, and Enterprise Software Architect.

Your mission is NOT to build a simple dashboard.

Your mission is to design the foundation of an enterprise-grade Injection Molding Process Analytics Platform that will evolve into a modular manufacturing intelligence system.

Think long-term.

Everything must be designed for future scalability.

----------------------------------------------------

# PROJECT PURPOSE

The first version focuses on one real industrial problem:

Reducing Auto Purge material consumption in uPVC Injection Molding without reducing product quality.

However...

The software must NOT assume that Auto Purge itself is the root cause.

Instead, it must discover the true process root causes using Lean Six Sigma methodology.

The system must support future modules including:

- Quality
- Production
- SPC
- OEE
- Process Optimization
- AI Recommendations
- Predictive Analytics

This first release is only the foundation.

----------------------------------------------------

# ENGINEERING PHILOSOPHY

The system must follow these principles:

1. Never optimize a symptom before verifying the process.

2. Separate observations from assumptions.

3. Separate measured facts from operator opinions.

4. Every recommendation must be traceable to collected data.

5. The platform should guide engineers toward Root Cause Analysis instead of parameter guessing.

----------------------------------------------------

# CURRENT MANUFACTURING KNOWLEDGE

The current industrial understanding is:

Material:
uPVC

Observed Problem:

Approximately 7% of total material consumption is Auto Purge.

Auto Purge occurs every production shot.

Reducing Auto Purge immediately creates:

- Burn Marks
- Material degradation near the gate
- Color instability

Therefore:

Auto Purge is currently acting as a compensation mechanism rather than pure waste.

Goal:

Determine the Minimum Effective Purge.

----------------------------------------------------

# CURRENT HYPOTHESES

The platform must treat these as hypotheses, NOT facts.

Potential contributors:

- Residence Time
- Cycle Time
- Holding Time
- Gate Freeze
- Shot/Barrel Ratio
- Nozzle Temperature
- Barrel Zone Temperatures
- Nozzle Retraction
- Screw Speed
- Back Pressure
- Dead Spots
- Process Drift
- Operator Parameter Changes

The software architecture must allow adding or removing hypotheses later.

----------------------------------------------------

# IMPORTANT DISCOVERY

The factory currently has no standardized process settings.

Each shift supervisor changes parameters according to personal experience.

Therefore, process variation between shifts is expected.

The platform must consider operator variability as a major analytical dimension.

----------------------------------------------------

# OBJECTIVES OF VERSION 1

Build ONLY the analysis foundation.

No AI recommendations yet.

No prediction yet.

No optimization algorithms yet.

Version 1 must only collect, organize, validate, visualize, and analyze data.

----------------------------------------------------

# REQUIRED DATA MODEL

The architecture must support at minimum:

Machine

Mold

Experiments

Observations

Root Cause Evidence

----------------------------------------------------

# REQUIRED INPUT VARIABLES

----------------------------------------------------

# ANALYTICS REQUIRED

The architecture must support future analysis such as:

Cycle Stability

Holding Time Analysis

Gate Freeze Study

Parameter Drift

Shift Comparison

Operator Comparison

Machine Comparison

Mold Comparison

Material Comparison

Defect Correlation

Trend Analysis

----------------------------------------------------

# SOFTWARE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Design using clean architecture.

Separate:

Domain

Application

Infrastructure

Presentation

Data

Avoid tight coupling.

Everything should be modular.

----------------------------------------------------

# GITHUB STRUCTURE

Design a professional repository.

Include:

docs/

src/

data/

schemas/

analysis/

reports/

assets/

tests/

examples/

roadmap/

----------------------------------------------------

# DOCUMENTATION

Generate professional documentation for:

Project Vision

Architecture

Folder Structure

Data Dictionary

Future Modules

Engineering Decisions

Known Assumptions

Open Questions

Roadmap

----------------------------------------------------

# IMPORTANT

Do NOT invent manufacturing facts.

Whenever engineering knowledge is uncertain:

Mark it as:

Hypothesis

Requires Validation

Needs Experiment

Unknown

----------------------------------------------------

# OUTPUT

Produce:

1. Overall system architecture.

2. Recommended folder structure.

3. Domain model.

4. Data model.

5. Entity relationships.

6. Development roadmap.

7. Future expansion strategy.

8. Documentation plan.

9. Risks.

10. Suggested GitHub repository organization.

Do NOT write production code yet.

Think like an Enterprise Architect designing software that will still be maintainable five years from now.
